# Overview

This project provides an opportunity for me to be creative and get to know the C Sharp language. I have heard of this language quite a lot in the past, and I've heard the term '.net' mentioned, but I've never had much exposure to the language at all before now. My goal for this project is to produce a working console based adventure game, with multiple different endings depending on your decisions throughout the game. I hope to learn the basics of C# syntax surrounding basic control flow through this project.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

This program was developed using the installed version of dotnet on my Windows PC (8.0.303), and VSCode with the C# Dev Kit extensions installed, using the C# programming language. 

I used the System library to provide console output.
