# Overview

This project provides an opportunity for me to be creative and get to know the C Sharp language. I have heard of this language quite a lot in the past, and I've heard the term '.net' mentioned, but I've never had much exposure to the language at all before now. My goal for this project is to produce a working console based adventure game, with multiple different endings depending on your decisions throughout the game. I hope to learn the basics of C# syntax surrounding basic control flow through this project.

# Development Environment

This program was developed using the installed version of dotnet on my Windows PC (8.0.303), and VSCode with the C# Dev Kit extensions installed, using the C# programming language. 

I used the default System library to provide console output and collect user input, with a JSON file storing the text for the game. I used the Newtonsoft library to read the JSON file.

# Future Work

- Id like to add data validation for the data in the JSON file to ensure null values are better handled on the off chance those are an issue.
- fixing the warnings about potential null references would be nice to complete.
- Id be interested to expand the gameplay and explore how additional factors like player health or other mechanics might complicate or further change the code.
